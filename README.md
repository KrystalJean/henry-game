## Intro - What is the Henry Game?

  Henry is a 90's game made by Tiger Electronics that I use to have as a kid where you push the Henry button to hear a sound, and then try to find the matching sound.
When you get the correct answer the key will stay lit, and you get to go again.
You need to get four lit keys in a row to win while you are playing against the computer, or two-player mode.
You have to light up the whole board in practice mode.

Here is a hilarious commercial from back in the day:

If you want to get a better look of the game in action, this will show you a video of someone plaing the game.  You can see how the buttons sort of have a glow to them:

## Progress of the Game

  Currently the toggle switches are non-functional, and the game is set up for the practice mode only.
  I decided to build this project to help me in learning JavaScript; therefore, I am not looking for any help with that part of the game at this time.
  
**I am looking for some help with the design of the game using CSS.**

This is the current game progress: (When you make design changes, take a screenshot and replace this image with it.)

## Licensing

  You are welcome to play this for fun, or take inspiration from the code to build your own things, but do know that I am just building this to learn coding, and this game should not be copied, or monetized in any way.
 Tiger Electronics owns all rights to this game.

1. If you see an issue that you would like to contribute to, please, ask to be assigned to the issue, so that we can avoid two people working on the same thing, at the same time.

2. It is perfectly fine if you decide that you no longer want to be assigned to an issue, just let me know in a timely manner, so that I can assign the issue to someone else.

3. When you submit a pull request that changes the look of the game, please take a screenshot, and update the README.md (this file) by replacing the old "Progress of the Game" picture with the new screenshot.  This should be included in the same pull request, as the other changes you made.

4. Have a good time.
